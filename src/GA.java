    Static class to provide the methods for the GA optimisation of one tour.
    The fitness is defined by the elements of the population with the smallest weariness.
    This means that the order of the gifts also plays a role as well as the total distance of the
    tour.

    Maybe use one thread by population in order to increase speed.
